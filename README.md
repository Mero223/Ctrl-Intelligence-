## Idea of this project:
- Name of the Web App: **Get Ready To Revidalize**

Many apps will help the users to  unplug from work or school by closing the app or remind the user that they have spent their allowed
time on this app, but they don't provide suggestions on how to unplug from your work or study.
The point of our app it to provide the reminder, suggestions on what to do when you unplug  and a chat bot that will 
help you with deciding what to do when you want 
to disconnect from your busy life.


- This Web app consists of a navigation bar that contains **Home**, **About**, **Contact** and **Profile** pages.

- **About** page talks about who made this Web app, what's the point behind it, why ReVidalize and what is it 
exactly to help the user with figuring out what is this Web App about and may answer any questions they might have
